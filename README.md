NOTE: Development of this project is indefinitely suspended in favour of [tmxlite](https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite)
which supports generic rendering across C++ frameworks such as SFML and SDL2, requires no external linkage and
has broader platform support, including mobile devices.

Usage
-----

With the Cmake file provided create a project for the compiler of your choice to build and
install the map loader as either a static or shared library. You can use cmake-gui (useful
for windows users) to see all the options, such as building the example applications.


To quickly get up and running create an instance of the MapLoader class

    tmx::MapLoader ml("path/to/maps");

load a map file

    ml.load("map.tmx");

and draw it in your main loop

    renderTarget.draw(ml);


Note that the constructor takes a path to the directory containing the map files as a parameter (with
or without the trailing '/') so that you only need pass the map name to `MapLoader::load()`. If you have
images and/or tileset data in another directory you may add it with:

    ml.addSearchPath(path);
    
*before* attempting to load the map file.

New maps can be loaded simply by calling the load function again, existing maps will be automatically
unloaded. `MapLoader::load()` also returns true on success and false on failure, to aid running the function
in its own thread for example. Conversion functions are provided for converting coordinate spaces between
orthogonal and isometric. For instance `MapLoader::orthogonalToIsometric()` will convert mouse coordinates from
screen space:

    0--------X
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    Y

to isometric space:

         0
        / \
       /   \
      /     \
     /       \
    Y         X

Layer information can be accessed through `MapLoader::getLayers()`
    
    bool collision;
    const auto& layers = ml.getLayers();
    for(const auto& layer : layers)
    {
        if(layer.name == "Collision")
        {
            for(const auto& object : layer.objects)
            {
                collision = object.contains(point);
            }
        }
    }


The quad tree is used to reduce the number of MapObjects used during a query. If a map contains
hundreds of objects which are used for collision it makes little sense to test them all if only
a few are ever within collision range. For example in your update loop first call:

    ml.updateQuadTree(myRect);

where `myRect` is the area representing the root node. You will probably only want to start with 
MapObjects which are visible on screen, so set `myRect` to your view area. Then query the quad tree
with another FloatRect representing the area for potential collision. This could be the bounding
box of your sprite:

    std::vector<MapObject*> objects = ml.queryQuadTree(mySprite.getGlobalBounds());

This returns a vector of pointers to MapObjects contained within any quads which are intersected
by your sprite's bounds. You can then proceed to perform any collision testing as usual.


Some utility functions are providied in tmx2box2d.h/cpp. If you use box2d for physics then add these 
files to you project, or set the box2d option to true when configuring the cmake file. You may then
create box2d physics bodies using the BodyCreator:

	tmx::BodyCreator bodyCreator;
    b2Body* body = bodyCreator.add(mapObject, b2World);
    
where b2World is a reference to a valid box2D physics world. The body creator is only a utility
class, so it is no problem letting it go out of scope once your bodies are all created. As box2d 
uses a different coordinate system to SFML there are 4 functions for converting from one space to
another:

        b2Vec2 sfToBoxVec(const sf::Vector2f& vec);
        sf::Vector2f boxToSfVec(const b2Vec2& vec);
        float sfToBoxFloat(float val);
        float boxToSfFloat(float val);

You should use these whenever you are trying to draw with SFML based on the physics output, or set
box2d parameters in SFML world values. When using box2d you may find that the build types of both
the map loader and box2d should match (ie both static or both shared libs).


Debugging output can be enabled with one of the following preprocessor directives:

    #define LOG_OUTPUT_CONSOLE

all output is directed to the console window
    
    #define LOG_OUTPUT_FILE

all output is written to a file named output.log in the executable directory
    
    #define LOG_OUTPUT_ALL

log output is directed to both the console and output.log
    
Logging is disabled by default. The level of log information can be set with

    tmx::setLogLevel()
    
by providing a bitmask for the level required. For instance to only log warnings
and errors use:

    tmx::setLogLevel(tmx::Logger::Warning | tmx::Logger::Error);
